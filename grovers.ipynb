    "Grover's search algorithm gives an averge O(sqrt) order improvement over classical methods, to invert a black-box function. It is often said that Grover's search algorithm can be used to search an \"unstructured database,\" like a lookup table. However, this requires a way to read a lookup table into quantum form that the algorithm can operate on, which is not a given, in the noisy-intermediate-scale-quantum (\"NISQ\") era. At least, we can imagine a unitary way to do this, if any hardware associated with any unitary operation is attainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "We search a lookup table with Grover's algorithm. Our lookup table is 1 \"page\" of _classical data_. To read  the lookup table into quantum registers, we assume the availability of quantum \"indexed addressing\" variants of \"load,\" \"add-with-carry,\" and \"subtract-with-carry\" operations. An \"index register\" of qubits points to an offset into the classical value page, to load a value within the page into a \"value register.\" The qubit-based index register can represent an index in **superposition**, and we can load values in superposition of the index pointer offset. This hypothetical operation is at least unitary, and reversible. This might be hypothetically attainable with a superconducting classical RAM cache."
