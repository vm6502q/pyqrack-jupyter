    "`QrackCircuit` can be converted to-and-from Qiskit's `QuantumCircuit` class, for ease of use. You'll notice that `QrackCircuit` needs the intermediary of disk input/output to do this, in cases: because `QrackCircuit` is ultimately at \"C++ level,\" rather than \"Python level,\" it can't directly do things like print circuit diagrams or list its internal gates. However, with disk I/O, it can rely on Qiskit for this, while `QrackCircuit` provides a fairly powerful way of simplifying input circuits and outputting fully-variational Qiskit circuits."
