    "Unitary Fund's \"Qrack\" quantum computer simulator framework simulates in the \"ideal,\" by default, allowing users to simulate measuring \"physically observable\" expectation values with no systematic approximation techniques involved. However, we know that \"ideal\" quantum computer simulation can scale exponentially in classical computer resource usage. Sometimes, it's acceptable that our results are instead only _approximate_, so long as this allows us to reduce simulation resource footprint. To this end, Qrack offers several approximation techniques that sacrifice \"fidelity\" to recover a smaller peak simulation resource footprint, including \"Schmidt decomposition rounding parameter\" (\"SDRP\") and \"near-Clifford\" quantum circuit approximation techhniques. (We will focus on \"near-Clifford\" techniques that approximate large circuits with a \"reduced density matrix,\" in this example.) Depending on available system resources, these approximation techniques might lead to a maximum achievable fidelity that is signficantly less than 100%, while employing Mitiq in addition, to mitigate the reduced-fidelity results, can trade off additional execution time, without significant additional memory footprint, to return higher fidelity results from approximate Qrack simulation!"
